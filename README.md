# mmdoc

The "minimal" Mercury documentation utility.

## What is Mercury?

A logic programming language with strong typing. For more info please visit [](https://mercurylang.org).

## Why mmdoc?
The documentation situation of Mercury (as of May 2025) is crude. The currently available documentation is technically enough, but the formatting is not friendly.

## Build

Clone and run `mmc main.m`. This woud produce an executable `main`; this would be one you'll use.

## Usage

```
mmdoc [input-file] [output-file]
```

Currently mmdoc can only do one file at a time.
